\section{Block Definition Diagram}
The following section shows the BDD of Rolling Road. The BDD is used to give a generel overview of the system and what components the system consists of.

The block 'Computer' contains the Rolling Road GUI. This block is not threated as being part of this system. The block should instead be threated as a parallel system which must be connected with Rolling Road in order to gain full functionality.

Likewise, the block 'AU2' refers to the car which has been designed to compete in Shell Eco Marathon and is not part of this system neither. It should be noted that this block can be exchanged with another car (as long as it meets the specifications of Rolling Road). This is represented by the dotted association between AU2 and Rolling Road.
