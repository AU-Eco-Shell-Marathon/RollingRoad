\section{Power Sensor}
The purpose of this block is to measure the electrical power delivered from the car's battery to the car's propulsion system. The power sensor must be able to measure both the voltage V over the battery and the current I delivered by the battery, as the power P is given by:
\begin{equation}
	P = V \cdot I
\end{equation}
